# **CONSTRUCTION SUPPLY CHAIN TRACKING SYSTEM**

## **PROBLEM STATEMENT**

The construction industry relies on a well-coordinated supply chain to ensure the timely and efficient delivery of materials and equipment to construction sites. Challenges such as delays, inefficiencies, and lack of transparency can impact project timelines and costs. To address these issues, a robust construction supply chain tracking system is essential. This project outlines a solution for effective tracking and tracing of materials and equipment in the construction supply chain. The system emphasizes transparency, data integrity, and collaboration among various stakeholders to optimize construction processes. The proposed solution's operating principles are outlined through system architecture, followed by testing, validation, and a comprehensive analysis of cost and security aspects to enhance traceability within the construction supply chain.

# **CONSTRUCTION SUPPLY CHAIN**

The construction supply chain encompasses the network of entities involved in the production, distribution, and delivery of materials and equipment to construction sites. This includes manufacturers, distributors, contractors, and various organizations responsible for logistics, research, licensing, packaging, quality control, lab testing, and shipping. Effectively managing the construction supply chain is crucial for ensuring that construction projects proceed smoothly, meet quality standards, and adhere to timelines.

# **ENTERPRISES**

## **SUPER ADMIN**

A super admin in the construction supply chain tracking system possesses special privileges and responsibilities. They oversee and manage the entire system, including user accounts, permissions, system updates, and security. The super admin ensures the overall performance and integrity of the system, contributing significantly to its proper functioning.

## **COMMUNITY ADMIN**

A community admin in the construction supply chain system manages a community or forum related to construction. Their responsibilities include moderating discussions, answering questions, and maintaining the technical aspects of the community or forum.

## **INGREDIENT SUPPLIER**

An ingredient supplier in the construction supply chain provides raw materials or components used in construction projects. They play a crucial role in the production of construction materials by ensuring the quality and reliability of the supplied ingredients.

## **MANUFACTURER**

A manufacturer in the construction supply chain produces construction materials and equipment. They provide information about the materials, including production processes and batch numbers, contributing to effective tracking through the supply chain.

## **ANSI**

The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) is an organization responsible for setting standards in the construction industry. In the construction supply chain system, ANSI provides information about regulatory requirements and standards to ensure compliance and quality.

## **DISTRIBUTOR**

A distributor in the construction supply chain transports materials and equipment from manufacturers to construction sites. They provide essential information about the items they transport, aiding in tracking through the supply chain.

## **MATERIAL DEPOT**

A material depot is a facility where construction materials and equipment are stored. They play a crucial role in the logistics and distribution of materials, contributing to the efficiency of the construction supply chain.

## **CONTRACTOR**

A contractor in the construction supply chain is responsible for managing construction projects. They interact with the supply chain to ensure timely delivery of materials and equipment, contributing to the successful completion of projects.

# **ORGANIZATIONS**

## **LOGISTICS DEPARTMENT**

The logistics department in the construction industry manages the movement of materials and equipment from production to construction sites. They coordinate storage, transportation, and other logistics activities to optimize the supply chain.

## **R&D DEPARTMENT**
